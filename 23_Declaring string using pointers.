// declaring a string using pointers.
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    char *ptr="Harry"; //"Harry" is string which is an array. An array is already anr address. So we don't need to use "&".
    printf("%s",ptr);

    return 0;
}
//This tells the compiler to store the string in memory and asigned address is stored in  a char pointer.

//Note:
//1.Once a string is defined using char st[]="Harry", it cannot be initialized to something else.
//2.A string defined using pointers can be reinitialized. ptr="Rohan"
