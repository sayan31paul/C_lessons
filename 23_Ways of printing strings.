#include <stdio.h>
//String is a array of characters terminated with a null character, i.e "\0"
/*Ways to initialize string in C:
1.String literals can be assigned without size. Here, the name of the string str acts as a pointer because it is an array.
2.String literals can be assigned with a predefined size. But we should always account for one extra space which will be 
assigned to the null character. If we want to store a string of size n then we should always declare a string with a size equal to or greater than n+1
3.We can also assign a string character by character. But we should remember to set the end character as ‘\0’ which is a null character.
4. We can assign character by character without size with the NULL character at the end. The size of the string is determined by the compiler automatically.*/
int main() {
    char str[]="Harry"; //string automatically asigns "\0" at the end of the string.
    char *ptr=str;
    while(*ptr!="\0"){
        printf("%c",*ptr);
        ptr++;
    }

    return 0;
}
    
//way 2
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    char str[]={'H','a','r','r','y','\0'};
    char *ptr=str;
    while(*ptr!="\0"){
        printf("%c",*ptr);
        ptr++;
    }

    return 0;
}

//way 3(most convenient)
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    char st[]="Harry Bhai";
    printf("%s",st);

    return 0;
}
