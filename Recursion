//Recursion:-A fucntion defined in c can call itself.This is called recursion.A function calling itself is called recursive function.
//A good example of recursion is factorial.

#include <stdio.h>
int factorial(int x);//prototype-We are telling the compiler that we will declare a function. The reunction will take an argument x as int and also return an int.

int main() {
    int b;
    printf("Enter the number\n");
    scanf("%d",&b);
    int a=factorial(b);
    printf("The value is %d\n",a);
    

    return 0;
}

int factorial(int x){
    if (x==1 || x==0){//This is the base condition.
        return 1;
    }
    else{
        return x*factorial(x-1);
    }
}


//Recursion is sometimes the most direct way to code an algorithm
//The condition which doesnot call the function any further in a recursive function is called the base condition. The function will go on running if the base condition is not present.
//Sometimes due to a mistake made by the programmer, a recursive function can keep running without returning, resulting in  a memory error.
